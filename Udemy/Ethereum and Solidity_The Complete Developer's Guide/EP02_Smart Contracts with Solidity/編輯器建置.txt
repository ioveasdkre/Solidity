Syntax Highlighters
Links to syntax highlighters are below.  Remember that syntax highlighting for Solidity code isn't strictly required, and we won't be writing a lot of Solidity inside our editor.  With that in mind, if you run into any installation issues I'd recommend continuing on rather than trying to troubleshoot it.
